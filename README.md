#Sentiment_classification
This project is to homework3-sentiment_classification of ML(machine learning)
of HongYe Li.
<br><br>
This project is using Keras and get about 0.08 loss in training with accuracy of
0.98 but get about 1.12 loss and 0.59 accuracy in validation data. The next step
is add **Regularization**, **Early stop** and **Dropout** to solve this problem.
However, because of the course of 'Tips of DNN', I decide to do something more
about project 'BP1'.
<br><br>
So,when I finish works on project 'BP1', I will continue this project.
